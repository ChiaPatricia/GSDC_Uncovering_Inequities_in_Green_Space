Modeling an Environmental-Social Green Space Index to Improve Community  Health and Equity

# Project Narrative
With the rapid growth of urbanization, green spaces in the form of parks, gardens, and
other open areas are extremely important for improving the quality of life for those who
live in urban areas. As polluted air and water and overcrowded cities become our
everyday lives, the physical and mental health of urban communities has undoubtedly
gained increasing attention in recent years. Not surprisingly, green spaces are coming to
the rescue.

Open spaces such as parks benefit communities by providing a cleaner environment to
protect public health such as a reducing in the urban heat island effect and improving air
quality. They can also have an impact on social health by contributing to increase
community cohesion and wellbeing, and increased property values, among other positive
environmental, social, and financial outcomes. As a result, the supply of green space and
the ease with which it can be accessed are key concerns in urban planning and
policy-making.

Traditionally, their impact on communities has been measured by the greenery they
provide. However, their contributions to community fitness and wellness should also be
recognized, which motivates us to create an integrated index to paint a picture of green
spaces in the U.S. To illustrate the impact of green spaces on community health, we
designed the Environmental-Social Green Space (ESGS), an actionable community
indicator derived from fitness, greenery and wellness.

While it is not always equitable to access green spaces within cities, it is important to
recognize this issue of environment justice and to raise public awareness of the benefitsof
green spaces for public health.
